# pytorch-dl-practice

## To-Do
- [ ] Implement more OOP / Functionalize code
- [ ] Import data and others in the way it's meant to be imported
- [ ] Clean code for printing
- [ ] Incorporate auxiliary scripts to create visualizations for understanding and README.md
- [ ] Implement a centralized form of helper functions that are commonly used
- [ ] Implement good global, local, and constant variables nomenclature
- [ ] Add better evaluation benchmarks and save them (using KPI and visualizations)...
- [ ] ... also for model against model!
- [ ] Implement good prediction/inference script (with visualizations)...
- [ ] ... also for custom data!
- [ ] Add the option to troubleshoot PyTorch models by passing dummy data into it
- [ ] IMPORTANT (BUG): fix when getting dataloaders (RuntimeError)
